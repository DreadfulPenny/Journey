# Journey
My journey into the wider cyberspace.

I am new to this, and this is going to catalogue my journey as I learn. A little about me, I have always been interested in computers and technology. I have built several PC's, done some DIY repairs on an Xbox Controller, replaced the battery and harddrive on a MacBook Pro, and love learning new things.  I am currently purusing a degree from Purdue University Global in Cybersecurity.  I have my CompTIA A+ and Net+ certifications.

I am currently studying for my Sec+ certification, I am probably ready to take the test but am wanting to make sure I pass it the first time I take it.  I am currently using Udemy to study, have several practice exams that I can take, and have taken an InfoSec bootcamp for Sec+.  I am currently on a small break from university and during this time, it's my goal to get my Sec+, CySA+, and Linux+ certifications.  I am also looking at potentially getting my CCNA cert as well.  I have approximately three years before I will switch career fields from Human Resources to Cybersecurity.  It's my plan to complete my degree within that timeframe, become more proficient in Linux, MacOS, and Windows.
